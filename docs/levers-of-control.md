Levers of Control

By Jeff Sandefer
## Introduction

The mechanics of business are straightforward. Find an unfilled need. Discover a way to make
and deliver a solution. If the price your customer is willing to pay to satisfy the need is greater
than what it costs you to make and deliver a solution, you have the beginnings of a business.
Repeat over and over again.

The hard part of business is _people_ —attracting new employees, screening them, motivating
them, and keeping them all moving in the same direction. You will spend your lifetime trying to
understand human nature and will, more often than not, fail.

How do you transform a group of individuals into a team? Is it better to lead from on high, to
exercise iron-fisted control and try to program every move until you have built a finely tuned
machine? Or, should you give people extraordinary freedom, so as to unleash their passion and
creativity? Somehow neither the rigid bureaucracies of the Fortune 500 nor the chaos of the
dotcoms seem to be appealing models.

This note is about a third approach—Levers of Control (LOC)—that appeals to the deepest
longings of human nature and offers a system of checks and balances that will keep you and your
people aligned with your mission.^1 LOC both empowers employees and holds them accountable.
It inspires people to rally around a mission that matters while setting reasonable limits on
individual actions. It helps keep everyone striving for the same goals while treating each person
as a valued individual. Perhaps most importantly, it does all of this with minimal costs and
bureaucracy.

## How LOC Differs from Traditional Management

Visit the business section of any bookstore and you will find scores of books about managing
people. Most are based on commonsense notions expanded to book length. Some prescribe
“managing by objective” and metrics as a central organizing principle. Others urge setting “big,
hairy, audacious goals” to inspire employees. Still others suggest that “managing by walking
around” will keep leaders more informed and make front-line employees feel more valued.

These “flavors of the month,” while helpful in some circumstances, are never quite fully
satisfying, especially when they’re not used in conjunction with LOC approaches. That’s because
theories that work in one industry are disasters when used in another. Strategies in boom times

(^1) This concept was introduced by Robert Simons in his book, Levers of Control: _How Managers Use Innovative
Control Systems to Drive Strategic Renewal._


fail when times turn tough. Each approach has unintended consequences when taken to an
extreme. Perhaps most disturbing, we often choose methods that cater to our preconceived
notions, making personal blind spots even more dangerous.^2

So what are these ideas missing? A unifying theory? A different recipe? Most likely it’s none of
the above. Management is an art—the seduction, screening, hiring, coaching, and occasionally
firing of employees—an art that requires judgment, not prescriptions or recipes.

Each of us has conflicting desires hardwired deep in our souls. We hunger to embark on a
mission that matters, but long for safety and security. We want to belong to a tribe, yet want our
individuality to be nurtured and appreciated. We look to authority for direction, but rebel against
rules that stifle creativity.

The beauty of Levers of Control is that it offers a systematic approach for touching these drivers
of human nature in a way that gives you the freedom to contribute as an individual while
remaining focused on a greater cause. LOC is not a simplistic “paint by numbers” approach for
management and leadership, but rather a set of tools that will help you hone the art of leading a
group of people or, even more importantly, training them to lead themselves.

## The False Choice: Top-Down Control or Unrestricted Freedom

Most of us long for one of two management utopias. Engineers and accountants want crispness
and predictability, wishing people could be more like machines. Visionary types like salespeople
and artists want to reach for the sky; they long for unbridled freedom, released from the
constraints of reality.

### An Engineer’s Dream: People as Machines

Machines are simple to program and control. Twist a knob. Write a few lines of code. Flip a
lever and a machine will run hour after hour in a predictable fashion. Want to change a
specification? Simply rewrite the code or buy a new machine.

Those of us who are engineers or accountants find people frustrating. People cannot be
standardized. People become bored if you ask them to repeat the same tasks over and over again
without explanation. People become demoralized and surly if you try to control them. Some of
us wish people could be more like machines.

Of course, people are not machines. To treat them as such overlooks the creative power and
resourcefulness of people who refuse to give up. Markets exist to serve people and allow
individuals to contribute their unique gifts to others. The freedom to choose is a part of our
DNA. We forget that rules can become straightjackets and hierarchies that often collapse under
their own weight.

(^2) For example, engineers and accountants love managing by numbers. Visionaries are drawn to ambitious but ill-
defined missions.


### A Visionary’s Dream: Unbridled Creativity

A world without limits is the dream of visionaries, artists, and salespeople. In this fantasyland,
every customer says “yes.” Supply is as unlimited as demand. The sky’s the limit. Imagine it and
you can build it. Build it and they will come.

To the visionary, engineers and accountants are non-believers and naysayers. Even the slightest
restriction is viewed as stifling, unnecessary, and unreasonable. Skeptics are viewed as cynics
who “just don’t get it.”

Of course, “trees do not grow into the sky.” Markets and science do have limits. Most
improvements are incremental, not revolutionary. Unfocused energy is usually frittered away in
an orgy of wastefulness. We forget that actions do have consequences; promises must be kept;
that true creativity begins not with imagination, but constraint, and that even large bank accounts
will run dry if not replenished by paying customers.

### True Leadership

True leadership, then, does not rest on a foundation of control or unrestricted freedom. The
essence of leadership is to attract and inspire the right people, with the right gifts to serve a select
group of customers better than anyone else—and to serve them over and over again in a
consistent fashion. The essence of leadership is to unleash the incredible creativity inside every
person and stoke his or her desire to make a difference until serving becomes a passion.

The goal is not to transform people into machines. Rather, we seek to find those who want to join
a mission, and by asking them to contribute their gifts, to serve others (customers, investors, and
other employees) in a quest that serves a need and, in the best-case scenario, changes the world
in some important way. We need to instill habits that make our service more predictable and
easier to execute—habits so embedded in behavior that they come to represent the character of
our teams and the cultures of our companies. If we can accomplish this, we do not need to make
people into machines; we simply reward them for doing the right things and let character and
culture become the destiny of the organization.

These are your jobs as an entrepreneur. To find a compelling need that begs to be satisfied.
Assemble people with the gifts to fulfill that need and organize them to do so.

Arouse a passion for excellence and create a sense of predictability and purpose out of the chaos
that is the real world. But how do you do these things in a systematic way?

## The Four Levers of Control

The Levers of Control framework gives you four “levers” to inspire, reward, lead, and guide
individuals so that each person can contribute something meaningful toward a common goal.
These four systems are in natural tension, acting as checks and balances rather than directives or
rigid rules.


**The four levers are: (1) Belief Systems, (2) Boundary Systems, (3) Diagnostic Systems, and (4)
Interactive Systems.**

_Belief Systems_ say: “Dare to be great! We are doing something that matters.”

_Boundary Systems_ say: “You have a great deal of freedom, as long as you stay between these
lines.”

_Diagnostic Systems_ say: “These are the numbers you need to hit to be rewarded.”

_Interactive Systems_ say: “You are important as an individual. Your talents and interests deserve
to be nurtured, and you deserved to be coached so that you can reach your full potential.”

### Belief Systems

Belief systems paint a compelling vision of your mission and how your organization will make
the world a better place. They describe an explicit set of beliefs that form a coherent worldview
that helps potential customers, employees, and investors decide if they want to join in.

Belief systems are important because they describe why a company should exist and define the
most deeply held values of the tribe. They are important to individuals because everyone wants
to contribute to a cause that is bigger than themself. The more vivid the mission and the clearer
the beliefs, the more compelling the goal and the stronger the bonds.

Start by crafting a compelling mission statement. Who will you serve? How will you change
lives for the better? Why will your mission make the world a better place? Be inspirational.
Speak from the heart. This is not a “Porteresque” strategic doctrine.^3 It should inspire people to
charge a hill. It should be a clear message about which hill must be charged, the type of people
needed to “take that hill” and, most importantly, why it matters.

Next, develop a list of “We believe” statements. Do you believe that cooperation is more
important than competition? Then say so. Or, if you believe in unbridled competition and the
survival of the fittest, say this instead. Take a stand. Are customers, investors, or employees
more important? Is making money your primary goal, or providing a nurturing workplace? Be
specific. The more crisply you draw the lines of belief, the easier it is to attract a cohesive team.
Post your mission statement and beliefs on a wall or a company intranet. Make wallet-sized
copies for every employee. Exactly how you share this mission statement and beliefs is up to
you. The important thing is that everyone on your team knows what these are. And it’s important
that you live by it, because if you do not, no one else will. Consult it when you have to make a
difficult decision.

(^3) Michael Porter is the leading guru of corporate strategy, and a compelling thinker. But even the clearest statement
of strategic intent is unlikely to inspire people to give of themselves. A call to change the world will.


### Boundary Systems

Boundary systems define which behaviors and strategies are out of bounds. They are formal
rules, limits, threats, and sanctions—the “thou shalt not’s” for your company. They are the
minimum standards for ethical conduct and warn against mistakes that could destroy the
company. There are no exceptions or excuses for violating a boundary rule.

Boundary systems are important for two reasons. First, they set limits that help focus everyone’s
efforts. They discourage people from wasting time, attention, and resources on sorties outside the
company’s main area of expertise.^4 Boundaries can be quite freeing because experimentation
within the prescribed lines is encouraged. Employees can make faster decisions without fear of
censure.

As an example, my first large entrepreneurial venture explored for oil and gas in the Gulf of
Mexico. Beyond a 250-foot water depth, the cost of drilling increased exponentially and the
skills necessary to be successful changed dramatically. One of the boundaries we thus set for our
company was that if a project was in water less than 250 feet deep, we would consider it. If not,
we wouldn’t.

Second, boundary systems protect your company against “below the waterline” mistakes that
could sink the company. What mistakes could one of your employees make to cause irreparable
harm to the company’s finances or reputation? The higher the risks of a single catastrophic
mistake, the clearer your boundary systems need to be.

Write down the explicit boundaries for your company and post them for everyone to see. Display
the boundaries in codes of conduct, operational guidelines, and promises to customers. Pay
particular attention to boundaries when reputational costs are high, when regulatory scrutiny is
intense, or when you want to narrow the search for new opportunities while you execute on the
tasks at hand. Every time someone steps across a boundary, there is a price to be paid, and
sometimes the price is steep.

### Diagnostic Systems

Diagnostic systems measure the results that matter. They are a dashboard that everyone can see.
They communicate—at a glance—whether the company is headed on the right course and at the
right speed.

Diagnostic systems are important to your company because what you measure and reward gets
done. These systems give individuals clear, frequent, and positive feedback for doing the right
thing and doing it well. They hold people accountable for their performance, while motivating
them and giving them control over their rewards. Diagnostic systems also focus scarce
management attention on high-priority tasks.

How do you create effective diagnostic systems? There are generally only a handful of numbers
that matter. You need a measure of customer satisfaction. You need to measure if you are

gaining or losing market share and which competitors are gaining or losing ground. You need to
track margins over time. And you need to monitor the capacity utilization of your most important
process or the turnover of your most important assets.

Which numbers matter and why they matter must be clear. The information must be available at
all levels of the company. The importance of the diagnostics must be explained clearly and
simply. Management information systems that do not lead to better decisions are worse than
worthless: they create bureaucratic barnacles of overhead on your company that slow growth and
sap profitability.

### Interactive Systems

Interactive systems are the intentional ways you acknowledge, coach, and develop individuals.
These purposeful encounters may be formal or informal and include performance reviews,
project management systems, mentor programs, coaching sessions, or simply an element of
“management by walking around.” (Remember, that by itself as a management approach isn’t
enough).

Interactive systems are important because they encourage individual creativity, make people feel
special and valued, and assure them that their contributions are valued as well. They allow less
experienced people to learn from more experienced mentors and individualized instruction.
Interactive systems develop deep bonds that transcend organizational charts. They allow leaders
to collect direct feedback from the front lines and set cultural norms by example.

In a small company, conversations around the water cooler or chance meetings at the annual
company picnic may be all that is needed. But as a company grows, interactive systems must
become more purposeful. Larger companies may need formal systems, but formality cannot
become rote or lose the personal touch. Perhaps most importantly, leaders must take the time to
mingle at all levels, always aware that each word or action has symbolic importance.

## Why LOC Works

Explicit beliefs, boundaries, and incentives that are aligned with an inspiring mission are the
recipe for a successful and enduring company, particularly if they foster strong personal
relationships between people dedicated to a common cause.

The four levers work because they inspire and reward the right individual behavior in a way that
coordinates activity without counterproductive bureaucratic interference. They are a system of
checks and balances on human behavior, a system of rewards and consequences that instills the
right habits and coordinates the choices of a freely assembled set of employees.

### Levers of Control for Individuals

Levers of Control speak to the deepest desires that make us human. We want to make a
difference in the world. We look to authority to tell us the difference between right and wrong.


We enjoy the positive feedback that comes from reaching a goal. And we want to know that we
are understood and cared for as an individual.

These desires sometimes conflict. Should I do the right thing or the one that makes the most
money? Should I dare to do something grand or stay focused? Do I care more about a
relationship or my own needs? Competing priorities and loyalties push and pull on each person.
Levers of Control provide guidance for difficult decisions, so making tough choices in a
consistent way becomes a habit.

### Levers of Control for the Company

Levers of Control send clear signals about who should join in the mission of a company and who
should not. It aligns behavior without becoming overly prescriptive. It instills good habits and
routines without dampening creativity. It encourages employees to dare to do important things,
without granting a license to charge off in unproductive directions.

Anytime you gather people together, there is tension between individual needs and the goals of
the company. There is tension between the desire to cooperate for the sake of the mission and the
need to compete for scarce resources.

Most people shy away from conflict and would rather bury differences than discuss them. As a
result, over time, many of us will begin to work at cross-purposes rather than quarrel. Others
look busy and accomplish little rather than taking the risk of doing something wrong.

Imagine that you and your employees are traveling together down a forest path. As long as you
stay near the center of the path and proceed carefully, all is well. If you stray too far to either
side, a hand or foot might get tangled in prickly vines. Go too fast and you might stumble into
danger, but go too slowly and you will never reach your destination.

You feel unseen forces pulling at each hand and foot. You feel the importance of the mission
drawing you forward; fear of the unknown holds you back. So how do you know which side of
the path is best at the moment? How do you set the right pace?

The Levers of Control are like invisible rubber bands on every person that keep everyone headed
in relatively the right direction. If someone begins to place too much emphasis on individual
rewards, the importance of belief systems begins to tug. Too much emphasis on conformity and
interactive systems remind each person of the importance of their personal contribution. Stray
too far beyond the common mission and boundary lines appear.

In the best companies, all four levers are aligned. The mission and belief systems complement
each other, thus helping to attract the right people and organize them in a way that makes sense
to satisfy a need. The boundaries crisply define where energy will be focused and prevent it from
being spent on customers better served by others. The diagnostics focus the attention on results
that show customers are being satisfied as cheaply as possible, with a strong return to investors.
Interactive systems help each individual find his or her right place, now and in the long run.


### Levers of Control for the Leader

Starting and leading a company is like being a parent. In the very best companies, the essence of
the company emerges from the DNA of a founder who is well matched to a mission that matters.
Beliefs are deeply felt and describe a clear course.

As the company grows, the founder has to delegate. If the company is small, you can do so with
a great degree of authority and control. The right individuals are attracted, nurtured, and become
part of a close-knit team.

When the company reaches adolescence, you must relax controls and allow people to make their
own decisions—within reasonable boundaries—as the costs of coordinating their activities
becomes too high. But how do you set limits so that employees can learn from mistakes and
grow, without destroying the company?

Over time, with explicitly defined levers, strong systems and a well-developed culture allow the
company to separate itself from the founder. This is just what a healthy parent would want for a
son or daughter.

## Adapting LOC for a Particular Company and Time

Different companies may pull harder on particular levers. Companies that rely on a motivated
sales force, for example, need regular doses of inspiration, whereas a petroleum refinery that
could explode if certain procedures are not followed requires a good deal more control. Other
companies need more collaboration than individual effort.

Most companies go through periods in which they temporarily need more emphasis in one
control area. By pulling harder on one lever than on another, a leader can move the company in
one direction without making an irrevocable change in the company’s culture.

## How Levers Change as a Company Grows

Over time, some levers change more than others. Mission statements and belief statements rarely
change, because such values are deeply held. Boundary systems may be relaxed as a company
develops new skills that can be used to serve a different kind of customer. Diagnostics can
change frequently. A change in the context or competitive environment may require a company
to focus on different short-term goals. As a business grows and its processes and markets mature,
new targets may need to be set. Interactive systems will change as different individual needs
arise and the company’s workforce becomes more diverse in talent or age.


## Summary

Levers of Control are more efficient than old style command-and-control systems that eventually
collapse under their own weight. They are more focused on results than “new age”
organizational systems in which anything goes.

If clearly drawn, Levers of Control helps customers, employees, and investors decide if they
want to join in a company’s mission. They describe which habits will be encouraged and which
behaviors will not be tolerated. They balance positive and personal feedback with constraints and
compliance. They provide consistent, gentle feedback so that the right actions become habits.

It is difficult to define a clear strategy. It is much harder to attract and inspire the right people.
And it is even more difficult to balance individual needs with those of the company. The hardest
task of all is to instill in people good habits that become the character of a company, and
eventually its destiny.

Levers of Control help you explicitly examine these tensions between individuality and
common goals, between control and inspiration, so your employees have a sense of the
purpose, direction, milestones, and individual freedom they need to change the world.
