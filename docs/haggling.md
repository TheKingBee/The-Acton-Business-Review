# The Art of Haggling

**Practice RLC: Rat Like Cunning:**

-   **Practice Ferreting Out Self-Interest**: Promise yourself that, in
    the next fifty encounters, you will ask questions until you have
    uncovered someone's real self-interest in a decision

-   **Practice Being Told "No"**: Just start selling. Once you've been
    told "no" a hundred times while selling door-to-door, the hundred
    and first time won't hurt as much.

-   **Practice Haggling**: How do you become a master haggler? Next time
    you are in a store, just ask: "Is that the best you can do?" Pause.
    Don't say a word. Once you get an answer, repeat the question with
    more emphasis.

-   **Practice Not Paying Cash**: This one is a little harder to
    practice But gather up some things you don't want and head for a
    flea market. Spend a few hours finding things you like better than
    what you have, and try to negotiate a trade.

-   **Practice Limiting your Downside and Picking up Free Options**:
    Begin looking for opportunities to trade away risks to people who
    would rather bear them. Then ask for free options

-   **Practice Being Skeptical**: Next time you are tempted to take a
    position based on emotion, pause. Suspend judgment. Ask "why?" the
    person is taking a position. Listen. Request concrete evidence, then
    ask "why?" again and again as you drill towards the truth.
