# A Sales Funnel or Word of Mouth (WOM)?

## Two Choices: 
#### Design and create a Sales Funnel
A series of steps to attract, qualify, educate, and close customers.

#### Create A WOM movement
To work hard to delight your first few customers, so that these early converts begin a Word of Mouth (WOM) movement that results in exploding revenues.

A sales funnel sounds like a lot of work, but more scientific and
predictable. A word of mouth approach sounds like more fun and
potentially much more lucrative, but harder to predict.

So which is better for your business? The short answer: It depends.

## The Benefits and Drawbacks of Sales Funnels and Word of Mouth

### Sales funnels
When well built and implemented, provide a
systematic approach to increasing revenues. Under the right conditions,
every step of the process can be tested to see which messages and
techniques increase close rates, add to customer satisfaction, or
decrease costs. 

#### The drawbacks

-   They're expensive to design and operate and, when done poorly, may
    make customers feel more like widgets on a factory assembly line
    than highly valued individuals. And the only way to increase sales
    is to pump more and better leads into the start of the funnel.

-   Sales funnels tend to work better for higher-priced functional
    products or simple image-based ones, where benefits can be explained
    and reluctant customers discarded at each step along the way.

### Word of Mouth (WOM)

Has the advantage of rapid, often exponential sales growth, at a very low cost. Plus, done properly, customers may begin to develop a deep sense of belonging, making it hard for competitors to lure them away.

-   Word of mouth is easy to recognize and fun to talk about, but
    unfortunately it's very hard to execute deliberately. In practice,
    it's difficult to ignite the right spark and keep enthusiasm at
    consistently high levels from one generation of customers to the
    next, because the technique depends largely on the emotions of
    crowds and societal trends.

-   Word of mouth sales also tend to work better for more complex
    "image" or "identity" products and services, or for faddish impulse
    items than for more mundane, functional products.

#### **How Do You Create and Execute a Successful Word of Mouth Campaign?**

1.  Start with a product that involves image or identity element of
    image or belonging---they say something about who you are, and they
    describe deep, important issues that you want to share with your
    "tribe."

2.  Create a message that's memorable and "sticky" so it spreads easily.

    a.  It is simple *"Get it there."*

    b.  It surprises you; it is unexpected *Tom's Shoes promises to
        donate a pair to a child in need.*

    c.  Concreteness Your senses are excited. Emotional words lead to
        something you can feel and touch

    d.  Credibility There are powerful testimonials from people who do
        not have any conflicts of interest.

    e.  Emotions You are touched deeply, often with a positive feeling
        like hope or gratitude

    f.  Story There is a simple, powerful, often redemptive, story

3.  Delight all your customers---capture, affirm, and arm the
    evangelical ones

    g.  Connectors know lots of people and enjoy bringing them together
        in constructive ways

    h.  Mavens are experts. They specialize in collecting and sharing
        information

    i.  Salespeople are persuaders. They convince people to take risks,
        to try something

    j.  they wouldn't ordinarily try

4.  Keep the conversation going -- make them feel valued part of a new
    movement and an important part of enlisting others in the cause

    k.  Once a customer engages, ask him or her for advice, and show
        that you take their ideas seriously and that you put those ideas
        to work.

    l.  Ask them to test and provide feedback on new products.

    m.  Even ask for suggestions for new products to introduce

5.  Provide incentives, but be careful not to try to purchase loyalty.

6.  Have strong "we believe" statements.

7.  Measure the right markers

    n.  Track what percentage of your customers says "yes" to the
        question, "Would you recommend this product or service to a
        friend?"

    o.  Measure how many new customers come from referrals.

    p.  Count the number of new product ideas submitted by customers.

8.  The right timing helps---a lot. Great stories and deep emotions are
    timeless. But context helps immensely too


### To spark powerful WOM

1.  Have an amazing and useful product or service

2.  Have fierce passion for that product or service and for letting those who
    can benefit from it know about it.

### Seth Godin's 4 Principle's 

**No matter how exactly you plan to execute, keep these basic principles
from Seth Godin in mind.**

#### **Transparency** 
Your customers aren't stupid. If they think for a
second that you're being inauthentic about your passion for your product
or service (and why should you be, really?), they'll bolt.

#### **A movement bigger than you.** 
How does your product or service help change the world in a significant way?

#### **Movements that grow, thrive.** 
WOM is about more that short-term tactics. How is today part of a growing, dynamic tomorrow?

#### **Exclude outsiders.**
How well have you chosen your customers and
followers so that you don't expend wasted effort elsewhere?

### **Which Is Better---Sales Funnel or WOM Campaign?**

So which is it? The truth is---you need them both.

-   WOM campaigns sound exciting, but they're usually too unreliable and
    unpredictable of a technique on which to bet your future. That means
    that once you find the right customer niche, you need a
    well-designed sales funnel: a repeatable, scalable process that
    gives you a higher probability of surviving startup and the early
    years of the launch phase.

-   But if you have the right products, and sense the spark of delighted
    customers who want to tell their friends, it'd be foolish not to try
    to fan these sparks into a WOM wildfire that could turn your best
    customers not only into a free sales force, but into a tribe that no
    competitor could lead astray.
