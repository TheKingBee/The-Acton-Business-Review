# Introduction To Customers

## Introduction

All other tasks in a business pale in comparison to the need to create and retain customers. The single most important step in launching an entrepreneurial venture is finding, attracting, qualifiying, and close customers who have intense, unmet needs.

Therefore, the overarching question of the Customers Tools course is:

**How do you identify, listen to and segement customers; price products and services; and build a sales funnel to close the right customers, at the right time, in sufficient quanitities, at as low a cost per sale and with as small an upfront investment as possible?**

## The Customers Framework

| Opportunity| Strategy | Sales Process | People 
|:-------------:|:----------:|:-------------:|:-----------:
**Do we have attractive customers?**| **Should we move forward aggressively or carefully?** | **Simple/small or large/complex sales funnel or word of mouth?** | **Do we hire hunter, gatherer, or farmer salespeople? How do we compensate?** 
|Is the customer need intense or trivial? | Are there clear segments and a large market or not? | Simple/small or large complex sales funnel or word of mouth? | Is industry experience or raw talent more important?
Are customers easy or hard to find? | Is this a large investment or a small investment? | Do we need to close few or many customers? | Do we hire and train from within or recruit?
Are customers easy or hard to lure away?| Does this product require a short or long sales cycle? | Will customers recruit or mobilize new customers?| Do we need Hunter, Gatherer, or Farmer salespeople?
Are there few or many substitutes? | Are we facing aggressive or benign competition? | Is gaining interest, communicating benefits, qualifying, closing, or service most critical? | Reward with money or with praise/recognition?
Is it easy or hard to communicate the benefit? | Do we move quickly or move slowly?| |Pay when orders are booked or when accounts are settled?
Is this solution low risk to try or high risk to try? | Do we price high or price low?| | Pay in Salary, bonus, or commission? Capped or unlimited?
Will the customer buy once or many times? | | | 

## Stages Growing In Sales

**Discovery & Validation ---> Personal Selling ---> Building the Sales Funnel ---> Running the Sales Funnel**

Use the questions where your business is in the sales growth process and what you need to focus on for success:

### Stage One: Discovery and Validation

- What are our potential customers' needs and desires?
- How do our customers value our benefits versus the benefits of substitutes?
- What are the specifications and experiences that will delight them?
- Question, observe, prototype, or missionary sell to conform?

### Stage Two: Personal Selling

- What questions do we need to ask the customer?
- Whom do we call on first?
- Have we sold at least one unit for cash, to a disinterested party?

### Stage Three: Building the Sales Funnel

- Which segment is the most attractive?
- How many customers do we need to attract and close?
- How long from first contact to close?
- Which step do I delegate first?
- How long until breakeven and payout?

### Stage Four: Running the Sales Funnel
- Where is the bottleneck?
- What are the most critical to monitor?

## The Most Important Tool: The Sales Funnel

Key questions for evaluating and running a sales funnel:

1. What is the average time between first contact with a customer and closing a sale withthem?
1. What is the most difficult step in the sales process: finding customers, creating interest,qualifying customers, explaining benefits, or closing?
1. How many customers do you expect to close next month? Next year? Five years from now?
1. At this pace, how long before your market is saturated?
1. How much do you have to invest to build the funnel? What is the monthly overhead tosustain it?
1. What is the contribution per unit (price per unit less variable cost per unit)?
1. How many sales do you have to make each month to cover your sales overhead (fixed-period costs)?
1. At your projected sales levels, how quickly will you receive payout of your initial investment in the sales funnel?
