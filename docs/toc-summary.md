# Throughput Accounting Chapter Summaries

## Introduction

The book has two main objectives:

1. Outline a new approach to management accounting based on the Theory of Constraints (TOC)
1. Compare TOC's paradigm with the traditional management paradigm (cost accounting, Activity Base Accounting)

**Goldratt brought concepts from Physics to Business Management**

## What This Book Is About

** How to make decisions according to the system's objectives. **

It is NOT a book of strategies.

- Chapter 1: The market situation and the role of management accounting in this context.

- Chapter 2: Cost Accounting's flaws and the rationale behind cost accounting

- Chapter 3: TOC's Basic Principle's and it's three measurements

- Chapter 4: Throughput Accounting Statements and how to make decsions using them

- Chapter 5: TOC-based throughput accounting vs Activity-Based Accounting(a cost accounting method)

- Chapter 6: The Assumptions behind Cost Accounting and it's consequences

- Chapter 7: Criticisms of Throughput Accounting

- Chapter 8: How to make other decisions using TOC (decisions not seen in chapter 4)

- Chapter 9: Paradigm Shifts in management accounting

- Chapter 10: Cost accounting strategies vs TOC strategies

- Chapter 11: Conclusion



## Chapter 11: Conclusion

### The Cost World:
- **DEFINITION**:  The Cost World is the "Constant search for high <u>**local**</u> efficiencies with the 
objective of maximizing use of the company's resources/activities"

- **The Cost World takes a system in the opposite direction of its goal.**

- Some defenders of "The Cost World" understand the above point: "JIT (Just-in-Time) production
policies also make traditional local efficiency measures such as individual
worker output and machine uptime invalid" - Johnson and Kaplan. Relevance Lost (p. 223)

<u>**Cost World Advocates DON'T know that:**</u>

- Traditional local efficiency measurements are **INVALID**
- Any measurement that stimulates high-local efficiencies is **INVALID**

<u>**Why the Cost World is bad:**</u>

- Cost drivers stimulate managers to optimize every link/activity in the chain.
** This does not lead to global optimization **

- Activity Based Accounting maximizes the efficiency of all individual activities
but not the overall system performance

- Traditional cost accounting not only inhibits good decision making but encourages bad decisions

- Activity Based Accounting (ABC) is a refinement of the traditional and cost accounting system
but still leads to bad decisons as all cost accounting systems do

<u>** Costs World's Undesirable Effects:</u>

1. Too complicated. Few Understand it. Expensive to implement.
1. Is not intuitive.
1. Does not choose best product mix, because isn't able to identify the products that contribute
the most to company profits.
1. Local efficiency measures increase WIP, decrease product quality, increase lead-time, and
worsen company customer service.
1. Cost allocation to products stimulates management to increase WIP and finished goods inventories
in order to artificially increase short-term profits.
1. Some performance measure are at odds with each other and with the company goal.
1. It suggests that some actions will improve performance when in reality they worsen performance.
1. Blocks some actions that improve the company's performance.
1. Creates the notion of cost per part that prevents the company from 
identifying improvements in its performance thereby creating a perception of
value that jeopardizes the company's marketing strategies.
1. Ignores the existence of a system's constraints becuase it does not consider the company a system.

### How A System Should Function

>An example of a system, well optimized, is a good orchestra. The players are
>not there to play solos as prima donnas, each one trying to catch the ear of
>the listener. They are there to support each other. Individually,
>they need not be the best players in the country.

>Thus, each of the 140 players in the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra of
>London is there to support the other 139 play-ers. An orchestra is judged
>by listeners, not so much by illustrious players, but by the way
>they work together. The conductor, as manager, begets cooperation between the
>players, as a system, every player to support the others. There
>are other aims for an orchestra, such as joy in work for the players
>and for the conductor. --- W. Deming (The New Economics pg 96-97)
