# Throughput Accounting Chapter Summaries

## Introduction

The book has two main objectives:

1. Outline a new approach to management accounting based on the Theory of Constraints (TOC)
1. Compare TOC's paradigm with the traditional management paradigm (cost accounting, Activity Base Accounting)

**Goldratt brought concepts from Physics to Business Management**

## What This Book Is About

** how to make decisions according to the system's objectives **

NOT a book of strategies

- Chapter 1: The market situation and the role of management accounting in this context.

- Chapter 2: Cost Accounting's flaws and the rationale behind cost accounting

- Chapter 3: TOC's Basic Principle's and it's three measurements

- Chapter 4: Throughput Accounting Statements and how to make decsions using them

- Chapter 5: TOC-based throughput accounting vs Activity-Based Accounting(a cost accounting method)

- Chapter 6: The Assumptions behind Cost Accounting and it's consequences

- Chapter 7: Criticisms of Throughput Accounting

- Chapter 8: How to make other decisions using TOC (decisions not seen in chapter 4)

- Chapter 9: Paradigm Shifts in management accounting

- Chapter 10: Cost accounting strategies vs TOC strategies

- Chapter 11: Conclusion



## Chapter 11:

### The Cost World:
- Constant search for high-local efficiencies with the objective of maximizing use
of the company's resources/activities"

- **This takes a system in the opposite direction of its goal.**

- Some defenders of "The Cost World" understand that: "JIT (Just-in-Time) production
policies also make traditional local efficiency measures such as individual
worker output and machine uptime invalid" - Johnson and Kaplan. Relevance Lost (p. 223)

- Cost World defenders don't know these are **INVALID**:
  - Traditional local efficiency measurements
  - Any measurement that stimulates high-local efficiencies

- Cost drivers stimulate managers to optimize every link/activity in the chain.
** This does not lead to global optimization **

- Activity Based Accounting maximizes the efficiency of all individual activities
but not the overall system performance

- Traditional cost accounting not only inhibits good decision making but encourages bad decisions

- Activity Based Accounting (ABC) is a refinement of the traditional and cost accounting system
but still leads to bad decisons as all cost accounting systems do

### How A System Should Function

>An example of a system, well optimized, is a good orchestra. The players are
>not there to play solos as prima donnas, each one trying to catch the ear of
>the listener. They are there to support each other. Individually,
>they need not be the best players in the country.

>Thus, each of the 140 players in the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra of
>London is there to support the other 139 play-ers. An orchestra is judged
>by listeners, not so much by illustrious players, but by the way
>they work together. The conductor, as manager, begets cooperation between the
>players, as a system, every player to support the others. There
>are other aims for an orchestra, such as joy in work for the players
>and for the conductor. --- W. Deming (The New Economics pg 96-97)
