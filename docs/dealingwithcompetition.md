# Dealing with Competition

-   Moral of the story: competition will arrive. Sooner than you think.
    That\'s the nature of creative destruction and a free economy.

-   The game is won through trial and error, one small operation
    experiment at a time. Rarely you'll see a way to change the entire
    competitive game, and build something even larger and more
    profitable.
