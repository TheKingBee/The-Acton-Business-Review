# The Sales Funnel

### 3 Ways a sales funnel can help

1. Predict how sales calls today will impact revenue later.

1. Calculate the average cost of making each sale and acquiring each
        customer.

1. Gauge the quality of prospects you attract, quantify the cost of each
        step of the sales process and note the number of potential customers who
        drop out at every step, so it becomes clear where you need to focus your
        efforts to improve your sales process.

### Sales Funnels vs. Production Lines

Assembly lines are about doing the right thing. Sales funnels
are about asking the right questions, offering the right
choices, watching what customers do, and praying they decide to
buy in the end.

### Just How Difficult is it to Predict Customer Behavior?

The actions of human beings are hard to predict and influence,
but if you break down a sales process into discrete steps, pay
close attention to why some prospects are more likely to close
than others, and measure how many prospects defect at each step,
you can begin to make the sales process more predictable.

### The Value of a Quick "No"

The only thing better than a quick "yes" in sales is a quick
"no." A quick "no" from a disinterested prospect frees you up to
search for a customer who truly needs what you are offering. The
worst type of prospect is one that takes up an inordinate amount
of your time and, only after a great deal of time, attention,
and money has been spent, decides not to buy.

### Building a Sales Funnel

#### The Major Questions for Sales Funnel Design
The design of your sales process will depend on whether your customers are:

1. easy or hard to find,
1. eager or reluctant to buy, and
1. worth a lot or a little to close.

Customers who are easy to find, eager to buy, and valuable to close
are an entrepreneur's dream. Customers who are difficult to find,
hard to convince, and of little value to close are an entrepreneur's
nightmare. It is with the "in-between" customers that the right
sales process can make the difference between success and failure.

#### The Major Decisions in Sales Funnel Design

-   Do you want to grow quickly or slowly?

-   Will your campaign be broad or targeted?

-   Will you have an intense sales effort to convince prospects to buy,
    or a more restrained approach?

-   Will you go to your customer, or have them come to you?

-   Will you take all comers, or be selective about the customers you
    choose?

#### What Is the Difference between a Lead, a Prospect, and a Qualified Prospect?

Unfortunately, we cannot tell from outward appearance when a
customer moves from being a lead---someone who is mildly
curious---to being a prospect who is more likely to close. We can
ask our customers questions, but they do not always answer
truthfully and often change their minds.

#### Staging Investments

-   We need to test as many sales funnel alternatives as possible before
    committing to large upfront and fixed-period costs.

-   Your initial estimates will likely be wrong. That is why it is
    important to stage, test, and carefully monitor the yield and costs
    at each step of the process. The longer your sales cycle and the
    faster you intend to grow, the more important it is to collect data
    early in the process so that you can adapt quickly

#### Sizing the Funnel

-   Once you've estimated how your sales cycle, the average costs per
    sale, and the capacity of the funnel varies for different sales
    funnel arrangements, you can compare your estimates of how quickly
    sales will increase to the overall size of the market.

-   You'll want to size the sales funnel so that you attract customers
    quickly enough to discourage competitors from entering your niche,
    but recover all of your costs and make a healthy profit before you
    run out of prospects.

#### Some Tips on the Sales Process

-   It is generally much cheaper to sort and qualify customers who are
    interested in buying than to try to interest and persuade customers
    (changing minds is expensive).

-   Each additional step in a sales funnel adds an exponential amount of
    complexity and cost. Communications and handoffs from one step in
    the process to another are expensive and difficult to execute.

-   Targeted approaches tend to work better than broad approaches.

-   Convincing customers to come to you is usually far more effective
    than having to go to them.

### Summary

-   Designing and building a sales funnel is much more difficult than
    designing an assembly line. Using machines to cut and shape widgets
    is much easier than attracting, informing, sorting, and closing
    finicky potential customers.

-   The difficulty involved makes it even more important to design a
    sales funnel that fits with the type of customer we want to attract
    and the benefits we offer. Each time we spend money to attract,
    sort, or convince customers, we must measure the number and quality
    of the prospects that move to the next step. That way, over time, we
    will learn to predict how to turn customers' needs into revenue as
    quickly as possible, at the lowest possible cost per sale, and to
    recover the costs of our sales funnel long before we run out of
    potential customers.
