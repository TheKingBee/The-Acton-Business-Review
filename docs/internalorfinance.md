#  Grow Internally or Finance?

You see an opportunity for growth that requires a larger cash investment than your
free cash flows can support.
Do you stick with growing only as fast as free cash flows will allow or do you
use external financing to grow more quickly?

It depends on:

1. Your confidence in your predictions
1. Your tolerance for risk.

The optimal growth rate and financial structure provides the highest risk-adjusted cash flows** to
you**, after all debt and equity claims have been paid.

##  Adding Financing Layer by Layer: The Basics

Your goals are:

- To maximize value for yourself
- To maximize value for your existing equity holders
- To raise as little capital as neccessary (to fund the right kind of growth)
- To never run out of cash

** Raise as much cash as possible form cheaper capital sources before adding
incrementally from more expensive sources **

Since you can not predict your customers appetite for your products or how your
competitors will perform you must prepare for several possible outcomes.

First, ask yourself these questions:

- How much cash will you need to fund growth in the early years?
- How much cash flow will the business produce in the later years?
- How much are these cash flows worth today?
- Which mix of financing produces the most value for you?

### Projecting Slower Rates vs Faster Rates

#### Slower Rates

- You can be choosier about which customers
    - PRO: It's easier to charge higher average unit prices
    - PRO: Lower average sales costs
    - CON: Less leverage to demand price concessions with suppliers
    - CON: Less leverage to ask for better payment terms from customers
    - CON: Less economy of scale benefits

#### Faster Rates

- You may be less choosy about customers
    - PRO: Costs may decline as you achieve economies of scale
    - PRO: Costs may decline due to more leverage over suppliers
    - CON: May require lower margins
    - CON: May need more fixed commitments like hiring people and renting new
    office or manufacting space
    - CON: If revenues disappoint, expenses must be immediately slashed or
    expenses as a percentage of revenues will rise.


## Sources of Financing: Cheapest Capital to Most Expensive

The basic funding options, listed from the cheapest to the most expensive, are:

1. Operational changes that improve the business model.
1. A revolving line of credit from a bank.
1. A term loan from a bank.
1. High-yield debt or equity.


### Operational Changes to the Business Model

Internal capital is cheaper than external capital.

Look for changes in operating procedures that can reduce cash needs and increase
cash flows to the firm.

Examples:

- Choose customers who buy in large lots, pay early, or pay top prices
- Choosing suppliers who will extend credit


<u>**There is no operational free lunch:**</u>
Shrinking Accounts Receivables will add SG&A expenses to collect unpaid
bills. Tighter payment terms might also affect sales.

### Revolving Line of Credit

- Accounts Receivable
- Accounts Payable
- Revolving Bank Loans
    - Ex: Credit Cards, Business Lines of Credit
    - Repeating 30-90 day terms
    - Balances roll overto the next term

### Borrowing Bank Term Debt

- Fixed Term, Fixed Rate, Fixed Amortization schedule
- Single 5-7 year term
- Interest and principle are paid from cash flow remaining after you have paid 
the interest on the revolving debt
- Rate is one or more percentage points higher than a revolver.

If you buy a company or an asset so cheaply that its purchase price and all 
the investment you need for growth can be financed with traditional bank debt,
you've probably made a good investment.

### High-Yield Debt or Equity

** <u>High-Yield Debt</u> **
- PRO: Can be refinanced with lower cost term debt

- PRO: Requires no loss of equity

- CON: Must make principal and interest payments even when company not doing well

** <u>Equity</u> ** 
- PRO: No pricinpal or interest payments or lenders to force company into bankruptcy

- CON: Permenant loss of equity and potential profits from a successful venture

High Yield debt is more advantagous when a company is very successful because 
retaining equity means more money for you. Financing with equity is better 
when the company grows slower than expected because there are no periodic 
interest and principal payments driving the company towards insolvancy.

## Running Scenarios

How do you decide between high-yield debt and equity?

The Steps:

### The Financing Progression
SGR > Revolver > Term Loan > High Yield > Sell Equity

#### 1) SGR
1. Start with the base case -- youre expected amount of revenue.
1. Determine how quickly you can grow relying solely on internal cash flow
1. If your business is not yet self-funding, determine how large of a 
primary sunk investment it will take for the company to reach a minimum
sustainable size. Use free cash flows from these cases as a bases for all other
growth scenarios.

#### 2) Revolver


#### 3) Term Loan


#### 4) High-Yield Debt.

#### 5) Lastly, Sell Equity


## Hidden Costs in Financings

### Long-Tailed Liabilities (Potential Time Bombs)

- Meddlesome Partners
- Personal Loan Guarentees
- Litigious Investors
- Friend/Family Investors

Ask yourself, "How much should I pay today, in cash, to avoid a problem 
like this?  Add this to the cost of financing before making a decision.

### Time and Cost of Raising Money

- How much time will it take to raise money?
- How much time and money will it take to raise each type of financing?
- Legal fees and commissions? 
- How much will you spend if the financing fails? 
- What will the time away from the business do to customers and sales? 

### The Care and Feeding of Investors
First-time entrepreneurs underestimate the costs of the "Care and feeding"
of investors.

- Legal fees and commissions are just the start
- Large companies spend millions on SEC filings
- Executives spend more time with analysts than customers
- If you grow only through internally generated funds you 
only have to answer to customers and employees.
