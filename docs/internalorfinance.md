#  Grow Internally or Finance?

You see an opportunity for growth that requires a larger cash investment than your
free cash flows can support.
Do you stick with growing only as fast as free cash flows will allow or do you
use external financing to grow more quickly?

It depends on:

1. Your confidence in your predictions
1. Your tolerance for risk.

The optimal growth rate and financial structure provides the highest risk-adjusted cash flows** to
you**, after all debt and equity claims have been paid.

##  Adding Financing Layer by Layer: The Basics

Your goals are:

- To maximize value for yourself
- To maximize value for your existing equity holders
- To raise as little capital as neccessary (to fund the right kind of growth)
- To never run out of cash

Raise as much cash as possible form cheaper capital sources before adding 
incremental funding from investors who demand higher returns

Since you can not predict your customers appetite for your products or how your 
competitors will perform you must prepare for several possible outcomes.

First, ask yourself these questions:

- How much cash will you need to fund growth in the early years?
- How much cash flow will the business produce in the later years?
- How much are these cash flows worth today?
- Which mix of financing produces the most value for you?

### Projecting Slower Rates vs Faster Rates

#### Slower Rates

    - PRO: Lower average sales costs
    - CON: Less leverage to demand price concessions with suppliers
    - CON: Less leverage to ask for better payment terms from customers
    - CON: Less economy of scale benefits

#### Faster Rates

- You may be less choosy about customers
    - PRO: Costs may decline as you achieve economies of scale
    - PRO: Costs may decline due to more leverage over suppliers
    - CON: May require lower margins
    - CON: May need more fixed commitments like hiring people and renting new 
    office or manufacting space
    - CON: If revenues disappoint, expenses must be immediately slashed or 
    expenses as a percentage of revenues will rise.
