# Putting Yourself in the Customer's Shoes

> ** Bootstrapping Entrepreneurship is "Adding Value, One Customer At A Time" **

## Would-Be's vs Master Entrepreneurs

Would-be Entreprenuers:

- Self-centered strategy: "If I build it, they will come"
- Don't "narrow the region of darkness"
- Have a high probablity of pouring lots of money into a dark hole

Master Entrepreneurs:

** OBSERVE > HYPOTHESIZE > QUESTION > REFINE THEORIES > EXPERIMENT > REPEAT WHAT WORKS **

- Customer-focused strategy: Understanding customer needs and wants is most important
- Take every opportunity to observe the habits of potential customers
- Anaylze how substitute products satisfy (or fail to satisfy) those desires
-  Observe how customers make decisions about products or services that satisfy
similar needs or desires.
- Ask insightful and probing questions.
- ** Run experiments to test the actual buying behavior of a customer **




## Observe

- What is the right price to charge?
- What are the available substitutes?
- What is the primary need or desire being satisfied?
- Have you accurately gauged the value to the customer?
- How much marketshare is reasonable?
- What questions would you like to ask people before you being selling?

## Hypothesize


## Question
- Focus on real customer not voices in your own head
- Get a representative sample of customers
- Ask the right questions
- Probe deeply
- UNDERSTAND: A small percentage of potential customers respond to questionnaires.
- UNDERSTAND: Many will not tell the truth or will repeatedly change their minds.
- UNDERSTAND: Many cannot articulate why they buy what they do.

## Refine Theories


## Run Experiments

- There's no substitute for experiments in which customers have to make real
buying decisions
- Do many experiments
- Alter one variable at a time

## Repeat What Works

- The explanation behind what works does not matter
- Just repeat what draws more customers


These techniques can help you predict prices, unit volume, the
    length of the sales cycle, the timing and magnitude of revenue, and
    the cost of generating sales.

   The best way to get inside a customer's shoes is to design
    experiments that help you predict buyer behavior before you sink
    large amounts of money into irretrievable investments such as
    factories or direct sales forces.
