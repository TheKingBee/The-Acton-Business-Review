# Putting Yourself in the Customer's Shoes

### 3 ways to put yourself in the customer's shoes:

1.  Observe how customers make decisions about products or services that
    satisfy similar needs or desires.
2.  Ask insightful and probing questions.

3.  Run experiments to test the actual buying behavior of a customer.

-   These techniques can help you predict prices, unit volume, the
    length of the sales cycle, the timing and magnitude of revenue, and
    the cost of generating sales.

-   Too many would-be entrepreneurs believe, "If I build it, they will
    come." Following this self-centered strategy yields a high
    probability of pouring lots of money into a dark hole.

-   A master entrepreneur takes every opportunity to observe the buying
    habits of potential customers and tries to form hypotheses about
    their motives. This leads to questions that help you dig more deeply
    into the emotions and habits that drive buying behavior.

-   Even carefully crafted and deeply probing questions have their
    limits. Some customers refuse to tell you the truth. Others change
    their minds. Many cannot articulate why they buy what they do.

-   The best way to get inside a customer\'s shoes is to design
    experiments that help you predict buyer behavior before you sink
    large amounts of money into irretrievable investments such as
    factories or direct sales forces.

-   **Observe. Draw conclusions. Question. Refine your theories. Run
    experiments. Do more of what works. Do all of these before you make
    large commitments of time and money. At its essence, this is what
    bootstrapping entrepreneurship is all about: adding value, one
    customer at a time.**
