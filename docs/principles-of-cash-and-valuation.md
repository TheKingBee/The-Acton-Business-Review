# Principles of Cash and Valuation

In this note, you will be introduced to Sahlman’s Three Principles of
Valuation:

**<span class="underline">Principle One</span>**

Value = Cash + Risk + Time

**<span class="underline">Principle Two</span>**

Sahlman’s Four Rules of Cash

1\. More cash is better than less cash.

2\. Cash sooner is better than cash later.

3\. Less-risky cash is better than more-risky cash.

4\. NEVER run out of cash.

**<span class="underline">Principle Three</span>**

Your goal in a valuation is to “narrow the region of darkness,” not
calculate a precise value (which is impossible). Hard work and attention
to your customers will close any gap between what you pay to acquire and
develop an opportunity and what it’s worth when you sell it.

Remember, your goal in a valuation is not precision—it is setting a
reasonable range of possible values. Hard work and satisfied customers
will overcome any minor mistakes. Stick with Sahlman’s Three Principles
of Valuation, and you will never be fooled by frothy markets or
fast-talking investment bankers
