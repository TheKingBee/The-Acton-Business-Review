# Pre-Tax Cash Flows & Breakeven

Do you want to know the secret to staying in business? Sell a unit for
more than it costs you to make by performing Unit Economics. *That's
it?* That's it. Or at least it's an important first step. 

Understanding the Unit Economic model on which your firm is built is the
first crucial step in getting a grip on the finances of your simple
firm. With unit economics, you can calculate pre-tax cash flow and
calculate how much money you’ll have at the end of the month if you sell
a certain number of units. It can also give you a sense of whether
you’re spending money wisely – and charging a reasonable price for
your work.

**Contribution Per Unit**

The amount of cash you have left over after selling a unit and paying
for its cost is called your "contribution per unit."

**Fixed Period Costs & Reaching Breakeven**

But, you argue, what about rent or salary? If you have these recurring
costs—called fixed-period costs—you'll need to sell enough units to pay
your monthly bills. That's called "reaching breakeven." And it's the
second most important step in entrepreneurial finance, because now you
can stay in business.

**Payout**

What about the machine you bought? Yes, you do need to recover that
investment. So estimate how much in pre-tax cash flows you'll be making
each month once you reach critical mass, and you can calculate how many
months it will take to get your money back. That's called "payout.” Any
cash you earn over and above payout is pure gravy.
