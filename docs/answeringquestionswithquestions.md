| Gathering information and testing the water | Discover their needs, desires, and potential problems upfront. This way, you won't walk into any traps later | Interesting question... why do you ask?
|                         |                   | Good question... but why did you ask me that one just now?
|                         |                   | I get the feeling... is that a fair statement? (If the answer is no, ask why?)

Just remember these three rules:

1\. **Answering a Question with a Question is an ongoing process.** Don't
just ask a question for the sake of asking a question; use the
information you gather from your prospect's answers to inform your next
questions.

2\. **Never answer an unasked question.** Sometimes what sounds like a
question is actually just a statement. Don't make assumptions. Don't
answer what you think your prospect is asking---they could be confused
or thinking aloud. Ask for clarification. For example, "The price is too
high" is not a question. You could respond with, "Does that mean
that...?" in order to get the prospect to nail down their precise
problem.

3\. **If a prospect asks the same question twice, answer it.** If you
continue asking questions, you'll set the wrong tone for the meeting.
The prospect will think you're being coy or playing games.
