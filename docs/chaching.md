## A Note

-   Far too many mid-level managers and corporate executives spend far
    too much time with whitecollar marketers like themselves and far too
    little time on the salesroom floor with salespeople, carefully
    tracking leads as they move through the sales process to become
    customers and then repeat customers.

-   The best companies pay special attention to improving their sales
    funnels, but even in these companies, the ability to build (or
    rebuild) a sales funnel from scratch is missing, perhaps because the
    existing funnel is taken for granted.

-   That may be because sales funnels are built by founders initially,
    not in a deterministic way, but through careful trial and error, as
    the founding entrepreneur becomes too busy and has to begin
    standardizing and delegating tasks. At each step of building the
    sales funnel, an entrepreneur has to sell through trial and error by
    keenly observing the path that the most valuable customers take and
    by looking to improve the volume of sales and the quality of
    customers, while simultaneously lowering the average cost per sale.

-   This process of constructing an increasingly effective and efficient
    sales funnel requires careful experimentation, a keen eye, intuitive
    leaps, and a fair helping of luck to identify the processes, skills,
    and judgment needed to make a particular sales funnel more
    effective. Despite the difficulty, building an efficient and
    effective sales funnel is well worth the effort. It is often the key
