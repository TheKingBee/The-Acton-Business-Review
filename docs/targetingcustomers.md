# Targeting the Right Customers

-   When we talk about "targeting," we're still talking about grouping
    customers, but as a trial and error" process, using a
    customer-by-customer series of experiments carried out by the sales
    department, carefully observing how and why customers buy, and
    creating provisional segmenting categories.

-   The ability to target the most attractive customers first, while
    efficiently expanding production capacity at the lowest risk
    possible, is one of the most important skills for any entrepreneur.
    There is little "science" to targeting. Rather, it is an art. You
    must observe and unearth needs, perform small experiments, and use
    these to correlate observable traits with unobservable internal
    needs, so that your business can focus on delivering exactly what
    your customers want, when they want it, and at a price and cost that
    allows you to make a healthy profit.

##  Tips for Collecting, Organizing, and Displaying Customer Data

 There is no magic formula for targeting and satisfying customers. In a competitive marketplace, companies are constantly looking for ways to identify and satisfy discrete groups of customers in ways that are difficult to copy. Finding such a strategy is a mixture of art and luck, often obvious only in hindsight.
