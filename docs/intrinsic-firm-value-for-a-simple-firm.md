# Intrinsic Firm Value For a Simple Firm

**IFV (Intrinsic Firm Value)**

IFV (Intrinsic Firm Value) is the NPV (net present value) of the
projected cash flows to you, the owner, based on your projections.

To find IFV: a terminal value is added to the free cash flows of the
terminal year. The free cash flow of each year is discounted back to its
present value. And the sum of these free cash flows is found. IFV can
also be found using the NPV formulain Excel.

**TV (Terminal Value)**

TV (Terminal Value) accounts for the value of all free cash flows beyond
the final year of your free cash flow projections. It is calculated in
one of two ways:

1.  Multiple \* EBITDA or

2.  FCFF in the year after the terminal year/(DR – stabilized growth
    rate of the FCFF\*)

\*For a simple cash gased firm with no working capital, no recurring
capital expenditures or debt free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) is NOPAT

**DR (after tax discount rate)**

**DR (after tax discount rate) is the rate of return required by an
investor to adjust for the time value of money (the risk free rate) and
the risk that future free cash flows may be lower than expected (the
risk premium). The higher the risk free rate and the less confident you
are about projections, the higher the discount rate.**

**NOPAT (net operating profit after taxes)**

**NOPAT (net operating profit after taxes) is an estimate of earnings
for firms with no debt. For simple cash based firms with no working
capital no recurring capital expenditures and no debt, it represents
free cash flows to the firm (FCFF).**

**Projected Data**

**Projected Data. First estimate future revenues. Then estimate what
expenses will be necessary to support a given level of sales. When
running sensitivities be mindful that once certain fixed period and sunk
investments have been made, you will be stuck with them, so vecause of
Operating Leverage, small changes in revenues can lead to large changes
in free cash flows.**

**Prepare Your Tools**

1.  **Set up calculations for EBITDA**

2.  **Set up calculations for Taxes**

3.  **Set up calculations for NOPAT**

4.  **Set up projection: number of years, revenue growth, COGS (fixed &
    variable), SG\&A (fixed & variable)**

5.  **Assign a discount rate**

6.  **Set up calculations for terminal value – multiple of EBITDA**

7.  **Set up calculations for terminal value – Perpetuity with growth**

8.  **Set up calculations for FCFF with TV (for a simple firm)**

9.  **Set up calculations for NPV of FCFF to get the intrinsic firm
    value (IFV)**
