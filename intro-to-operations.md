**W1 Intro: Operations & Costs**

You can increase *capacity* by increasing the number of units you can
make and deliver at any one time. You can increase *efficiency* by
lowering the cost of making each unit.

The overarching question of the Operations & Costs course is: How do you
build a production---or service---delivery process that delivers exactly
the right product or service, in the right quantities, at the right
time, with the lowest cost per unit and the smallest upfront investment
possible?

In these unit economics experiences, you will practice asking the most
important questions of entrepreneurship, like:

• How many units do you need to sell to reach cash flow breakeven and
stop hemorrhaging cash? • Once your business reaches a critical mass,
how long will it take to reach payout and recover your investment?

• How do you measure---in cash---how costs and profits will vary with
sales, over a variety of production-process archetypes?

• What simple ways exist for you to value your business once it reaches
critical mass?

Put yourself in the customers shoes Operations are not about what you
want to produce. It is about what the customer wants you to produce.
Never lose sight of this.

Create a culture that fosters continuous improvement. Look for
bottlenecks, the obstacle that keeps the whole line from improving
throughput.

Dealing with Bottlenecks:

> • Subordinate everything else to the above decision

> • Elevate the bottleneck

> • Go Back to the first step, and repeat . . .
